    "The spice must flow.",
    "I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.",
    "May thy knife chip and shatter.",
    "There is no escapeâ€”we pay for the violence of our ancestors.",
    "Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.",
    "The power to destroy a thing is the absolute control over it."

<h2>console.log</h2>

<p>Unlike an alert, console.log does not stop the JavaScript from continuing. It logs to the console and continues on its merry way.</p>

<pre class="fragment"><code data-trim>
// This isn't nearly so annoying with console.log.
for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
</code></pre>

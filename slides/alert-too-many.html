<h2>Alert</h2>

<p>If you accidentally put an alert in a place that runs a lot of times, it can get annoying really fast. In the past, I occasionally had to kill a browser and restart it.</p>

<pre><code data-trim>
// I heard you like alerts...
for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  alert(i);
}
</code></pre>

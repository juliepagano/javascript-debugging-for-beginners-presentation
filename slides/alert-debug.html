<h2>Alert</h2>

<p>This is useful for debugging because you can set the alert value to something meaningful.</p>

<pre><code data-trim>
// I want to know if I reach this part of the code.
alert("I am here!");

// I want to know the value of foo in this part of the code.
alert("Foo: " + foo);
</code></pre>
